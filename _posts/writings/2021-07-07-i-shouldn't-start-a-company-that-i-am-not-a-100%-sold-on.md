> _Note: A company that I am not a 100% sold on refers to ideas that are mildly interesting to me, but not interesting enough that make me go "wow let's get started"._

I'd think that most people's immediate response to that statement, without much thought, would be, "Of course not." Perhaps, that gut response is what's right. But here, I break down my thoughts and see if I agree with the gut response, or not.

Initially, I toyed with the idea that I should make the most out of being in EF by starting a startup no matter what. A startup in almost any industry, building almost any kind of product or service. Just start one, even if I am not a 100% sold by the problem that I am trying to solve.

Simply because I might be missing out if I don't start a startup right now with EF. I'm in a programme designed precisely for that, so surely it makes sense that I can make the most out of being in the programme by starting a startup. Plus, even if I am not a 100% into my startup's business, I'll be sure to learn something that can help me when I eventually get to building my magnum opus startup.

I think I might just have realised that this reasoning will cost me more than its potential benefits.

Firstly, I am not "missing out" if I don't end up incorporating a company at the end of 3 months. EF puts me in an environment that gives the illusion of "missing out" (at least for me) when I drop out. I am missing out on bringing these great ideas to life. I am missing out on becoming a CTO and running my own company (I'd assume that this is pretty important to most people that choose to join EF). But not really, no. There are many ways of starting a company, doing it through EF is just one of them. Does EF make it easier to find a good idea and start a company though? While that question is reasonable and debatable, it should not have an impact on my decision to start a company at EF (I should not be starting a company in EF mainly because it is easier to do it with EF than without). So, I'm not really missing out.

Secondly, I definitely _should_ still make the most out of my time at EF, but starting a company that I am not a 100% sold on is not the only way I _could_ make the most out of my time at EF. To me, I _should_ make the most out of EF by being open to ideas, building meaningful long-term relationships, possibly sharpening my understanding on things and if I am lucky, learning what my _specific knowledge_ [1] is.

Thirdly, I don't have to start a startup that I am not 100% in, just to prepare myself for eventually starting my magnum opus, billion-dollar startup. That is simply not a good enough reason to dedicate the next 10 years of my life to something I don't feel strongly enough about. All business are different enough that I'd expect to still be "learning the ropes" in my second venture. Sure, having done a startup before would have taught me some things. But because all businesses are different, I don't think it would teach me enough such that I can significantly increase my chances of success at my next startup.

The question then becomes, "How do I know if I am a 100% sold on an idea or problem or business proposition?" This I am still figuring out. It probably is a function of my specific knowledge, interests, and the people I am working with.
