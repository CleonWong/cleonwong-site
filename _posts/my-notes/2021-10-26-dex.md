# 1. What is a DEX

- Decentalised exchanges (DEXs) are autonomous decentalised applications (DApps) that allow cryptocurrency buyers or sellers to trade without having to give up control over their funds to any intermediary or custodian [(CMC)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-decentralized-exchanges-dex).
- For the typical centralised exchanges (CEXs) for cryptocurrencies, buyers and/or sellers hand their crypto assets to the CEX in order for trades to happen.
  - Not necessary to dive into why this is the case.
- DEXs rely on self-executing smart contracts to facilitate autonomous trades that can happen without any intermediary custodians.
- Essentially, DEXs are exactly what they sound like - a decentralised _way_ for you to trade crypto.
- The more interesting question is "How does a DEX work?".

## 1.1. DEXs vs CEXs

- Because of the lack of intermediaries (aka the use of smart contacts) to facilitate trades on DEXs:
  - You retain custody of your crypto and are responsible for managing your wallets and private keys.
  - DEXs have limited counterparty risk and are not required to follow KYC or AML regulatory standards.
    - Counterparty risk refers to the possibility that a party involved ina transaction will fail to meet their obligations.
    - Lack of counterparty risk because the smart contract will only be automatically executed once the required conditions have been met.
- The above points do not hold for CEXs.
  - E.g. CEXs usually are custodians of your crypto assets, you have to pass a CEX's KYC check before you are able to create an account / use their services.

# 2. How does a DEX work

- Slightly more interesting because a DEX can work multiple ways, implying that there are different types of DEXs.

## 2.1. Types of DEXs

### 2.1.1. On-chain order books

- testing

### 2.1.2. Off-chain order books

- testing

### 2.1.3. Automated market makers (AMMs)

- testing

# 3. How are DEXs different from CEXs

- Differences in how they work
  - How exchange price is determined?
  - How the trade happens?
- How does liquidity / illiquidity affect their function

# 4. DEX'es, order books, liquidity pools, swaps, AMMs, aggregators

- How are they all related to each other?
