# What is a DEX

- Decentalised exchanges (DEXs) are autonomous decentalised applications (DApps) that allow cryptocurrency buyers or sellers to trade without having to give up conrtol over their funds to any intermediary or custodian [(CMC)](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-decentralized-exchanges-dex).
- For the typical centralised exchanges (CEXs) for cryptocurrencies, buyers and/or sellers hand their crypto assets to the CEX in order for trades to happen.
- DEXs use smart contracts to enable autonomous trades that can happen without any intermediary custodians.
- Essentially, DEXs are exactly what they sound like - a decentralised way for you to trade crypto.
- The more interesting question is "How does a DEX work?".

# How does a DEX work

- This question is interesting because a DEX can work multiple ways. Implying that there are different types of DEXs.

## Types of DEXs

### 1. On-chain order books

- testing

### 2. Off-chain order books

- testing

### 3. Automated market makers (AMMs)

- testing

# How are DEXs different from CEXs

- Differences in how they work
  - How exchange price is determined?
  - How the trade happens?
- How does liquidity / illiquidity affect their function

# DEX'es, order books, liquidity pools, swaps, AMMs, aggregators

- How are they all related to each other?
