# Learning SQL

Learning SQL should be straightforward and easy. What then sets me apart from every other SQL monkeys out there then?

**Why am I learning SQL?**

- I'm supposed to be a data scientist lol
- For upcoming interviews
- For settling backend and cron jobs for [socean.fi](https://socean.fi)

**Additional things to understand, if time allows:**

- Everything about relational databases (DBs), since SQL is a language for relational DBs.

### 1.1. Key concepts taught

- Basic:

  - `SELECT`
  - `WHERE`
  - `GREATER THAN`, `AND`, `OR`, `IN`, `NOT`, `LIKE` operators

- Functions:

  - `CASE`
  - `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`
  - `GROUP BY`, `COALECSE`, `HAVING`

- Joins:

  - `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `UNION JOIN`, `SELF JOIN`
  - Table and column aliases

- Edit data:

  - `UPDATE`, `INSERT INTO`, `DELETE`

### 1.2. My review

- Best for beginners that want a very quick _introduction_ to some key concepts of SQL.
  - Introduction because each concept is only taught once. No repetition.
- Quick and dirty way of learning SQL for beginners. No videos to slow you down, the course is just all text, examples and simple coding exercises.
- Able to complete in a few hours.
- There are some minor syntax inconsistencies in the solutions.
- Bad: Not every concept has an exercise for you to code and practice.
