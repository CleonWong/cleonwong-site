# Learning SQL

Learning SQL should be straightforward and easy. What then sets me apart from every other SQL monkeys out there then?

I might leave a quick review of the resources that I use here as well.

**Why am I learning SQL?**

- I'm supposed to be a data scientist lol
- For upcoming interviews
- For settling backend and cron jobs for [socean.fi](https://socean.fi)

**Additional things to understand, if time allows:**

- Understand relational databases (DBs), since SQL is a language for relational DBs.

### 1.1. Key concepts taught

### 1.2. My review

- Best for beginners that want a very quick _introduction_ to some key concepts of SQL.
- Quick and dirty way of learning SQL for beginners. No videos to slow you down, the course is just all text, examples and simple coding exercises.
- Able to complete in a few hours.
- There are some minor syntax inconsistencies in the solutions.
