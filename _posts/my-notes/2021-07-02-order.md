# What is an "order"

To understand what is an order book and why it even exists, we need to first understand what an **order** is.

An **order** is a set of instructions to a broker to buy or sell an asset. There are multiple order types. What this _set of instructions_ comprise depends on the order type (typically, the set of instructions between order types defer on what price the trader wishes to buy or sell the asset at, when the trader wishes and will buy or sell and the quantity that the trader wishes to buy or sell).

Investopedia has a comprehensive [list of order types](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/order.asp#:~:text=Orders%20are%20used%20to%20buy,sell%20as%20the%20buyer's%20price.).
