It's about time to recalibrate my goals and plans. Really think about what's important to me. Then come up with an actionable game plan.

I need to do this because the past two months spent trying to start a startup has made me question what I am good at, what I want to be good at, and what do I want out of a career. I still don't have clear answers, but it is starting to feel like I have been making poor decisions regarding my career. Hence, it is time to recalibrate and be intentional about my next steps.

Note: To me, career == life's work. So my thoughts on "career decision" address more on the meaning, value and significance of careers, more so than the smaller details such as "working at company A instead of company B" (those two are not mutually exclusive of course).
